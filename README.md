# ACE Command Line Fundamentals (Lab)
Introductory command line workshop, presented by the SCIS ACE Programme.

## Creating your own Lab environment
_Pre-requisites: Docker and Git installed on your computer_

1. Clone this git repository to download the code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wenlianggg/ace-cli-workshop 
```

2. Change your directory into the repository with the code
```bash
cd ace-cli-workshop
```

3. Run Docker Compose to build and run this Docker image. \
Please bear in mind that this step might take up to **10 minutes** depending on the speed of your computer and internet bandwidth.
If `docker compose` does not work on your computer, try `docker-compose`
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.personal.yml build
```

4. Start the Docker containers.
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.personal.yml up -d
```

5. You should now be able to SSH into your own container. Please note that only ports 3201 and 3202 are made available in the `docker-compose.personal.yml` as it is meant for your use only.
```bash
ssh workshop@localhost -p 3201
```
When prompted, provide the password `aceCLI!`

If you're curious about how the lab environment is set up with Docker, please check out the contents of `Dockerfile` to see how the image is created.

The maximum candidature period (single and double degree) is 6 years. Students who are unable to complete all requirements for the award of their degree (refer to Requâ€‹irements for the Degree) by their maximum candidature period will have their student registration status terminated. Accordingly, they will be withdrawn from the University.
During the candidature period, generally, a student must enrol for at least 1 course unit and not more than 5.5 course units of study per term.

The government funding for undergraduate education would subsidize the tuition fee of undergraduate students (single and double degree) up to the normal candidature of four years, for those who took up the Government Tuition Grant.  Students should graduate within the normal candidature period.  The candidature period includes time taken to fulfill the internship,  community service, finishing touch,  external study programmes (such as international exchange, local exchange, short-term study programme) and any other graduation requirements as stipulated for the programme. Leave of absence that has been approved will not count towards the candidature period.

If a student has yet to graduate after the 4th year of study, there will be no further funding. The University, therefore, is compelled to bill the student at the full rate of the tuition fee, as stipulated in the Tuition Grant and Eligibility.
